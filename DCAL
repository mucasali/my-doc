We've seen 
that `{% raw %}{{todo.title}}{% endraw %}` accesses 
the `title` property of the `todo` item on the current 
data context. Additionally, `..` accesses the parent data 
context (rarely a good idea), `list.todos.[0]` accesses the first element of the `todos` array on `list`.

Note that Spacebars is very forgiving of `null` values. It will 
not complain if you try to access a property on a `null` value
(for instance `foo.bar` if `foo` is not defined), 
but instead simply treats it also as null. However there are exceptions to this---trying to call a 
`null` function, or doing the same *within* a helper will lead to exceptions.
